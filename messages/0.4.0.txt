MBXTools package version NEXT

Release notes:

    * Set custom MBX extensions (e.g., `.xml`) in User Settings
      (key "mbx_file_exts")
    * Commands to set this value and "mbx_root_file" via input panel
    * Completion insertion using completion list instead of quick panel

Known issues:

    * There should be a command to clear the MBX root file.
    * Some important math snippets are still missing. Please open an issue if
      there is something you desperately need.
