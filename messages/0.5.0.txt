Release notes:

    * Package name will change when this version is bumped to 0.5.0
    * Discontinue support for first-line <!--MBX--> comment file recognition
    * Simplified syntax and updated scopes to match current ST scope naming
      recommendations (https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/scope_naming.html)
    * Change many names to PreTeXt (but the rest, including a package rename,
      will wait for the official version)
    * Change some snippets to reflect extensive changes/deprecations in schema

Known issues from 0.4.5 (none fixed in this release):

    * Mirrored title text in snippet xml:id does not always give
      completely satisfactory results (e.g., XML tags inside)
        - Should there be a user setting to disable this mirroring?
        - Is this even possible?
    * PreTeXt syntax is inappropriately applied to files of
      other types in some instances
    * Typing '<xref ref=""' results in a spurious error ("ref/cite:
      unrecognized format")
    * Potential for confusion since Symbols List is always based on
      the current project (or open folder) but the ref autocomplete
      list may not be (if there is not an explicit project and the
      root PreTeXt file is set globally or not at all)
