Release notes:

    * Discontinue support for first-line <!--MBX--> comment file recognition;
      only extension-based recognition is supported
    * Simplified syntax and updated scopes to match current ST scope naming
      recommendations (https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/scope_naming.html)
    * Improved scoping supports embedded LaTeX, Python/Sage, R, Javascript,
      Julia, C, C++ syntax definitions in appropriate contexts: scoping is
      not perfect and you will notice aberrations, please feel free to report them
    * Change many names to PreTeXt, including package name
    * Change some snippets to reflect extensive changes/deprecations in schema

Known issues:

    * The scoping for embedded syntaxes is not completely satisfactory
    * Symbol recognition is not as good as before

Known issues from 0.4.5 not fixed in this release:

    * Symbol recognition lists are incomplete
    * Mirroring title text to get xml:id is good for divisions, but less
      good for theorems (often not titled)
    * Mirrored title text in snippet xml:id does not always give
      completely satisfactory results (e.g., XML tags inside)
        - Should there be a user setting to disable this mirroring?
        - Is this even possible?
    * Typing '<xref ref=""' results in a spurious error ("ref/cite:
      unrecognized format")
    * Potential for confusion since Symbols List is always based on
      the current project (or open folder) but the ref autocomplete
      list may not be (if there is not an explicit project and the
      root PreTeXt file is set globally or not at all)
