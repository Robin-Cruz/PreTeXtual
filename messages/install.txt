PreTeXtual package, public (pre-)release:

Thank you for your interest in PreTeXtual. Make sure to inspect the README.md
for instructions on usage and configuring your MathBook XML files to work
automatically with PreTeXtual. If you find a bug or have a feature request,
please open an issue at

    https://github.com/daverosoff/PreTeXtual

I hope you find PreTeXtual useful!

Known issues:

    * Mirrored title text in snippet xml:id does not always give
      completely satisfactory results (e.g., XML tags inside)
        - Should there be a user setting to disable this mirroring?
        - Is this even possible?
    * MathBook XML syntax is inappropriately applied to files of
      other types in some instances
    * Typing '<xref ref=""' results in a spurious error ("ref/cite:
      unrecognized format")
    * Potential for confusion since Symbols List is always based on
      the current project (or open folder) but the ref autocomplete
      list may not be (if there is not an explicit project and the
      root MBX file is set globally or not at all)
