PreTeXtual package, public (pre-)release:

Thank you for your interest in PreTeXtual. Make sure to inspect the README.md
for instructions on usage and configuring your PreTeXt files to work
automatically with PreTeXtual. If you find a bug or have a feature request,
please open an issue at

    https://github.com/daverosoff/PreTeXtual

I hope you find PreTeXtual useful!

This version of PreTeXtual can work with a special type of virtual machine
called a Vagrant box. This allows Windows users to install and use PreTeXt
from within Sublime Text. Video help with setup and use examples is available
at

    https://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/doc/

These features are also documented to some degree in the Author's Guide (at
the above site).
