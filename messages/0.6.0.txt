Release notes:

    * Sublime Text build system (Windows only) added. This feature, which is
      still experimental, is the reason for the new release (no other known issues
      have been addressed). See README.md for complete details on setting up
      your environment to use the build system commands.

Known issues:
    * The install process is not as painless as one might wish, but is perhaps
      best possible for Sublime Text 3
    * Potential for confusion since the "PreTeXt root file" setting
      is used for the symbol list, but a different setting is used to
      specify root file for Vagrant-enabled builds. The global "root
      file" setting will be deprecated in a future version.
    * Work on the Vagrant build systems has supplanted work on the syntax
      definition, which now does not completely reflect the schema

Known issues from 0.5.0 not fixed in this release:

    * The scoping for embedded syntaxes is not completely satisfactory
    * Symbol recognition is not as good as before

Known issues from 0.4.5 not fixed in this release:

    * Symbol recognition lists are incomplete
    * Mirroring title text to get xml:id is good for divisions, but less
      good for theorems (often not titled)
    * Mirrored title text in snippet xml:id does not always give
      completely satisfactory results (e.g., XML tags inside)
        - Should there be a user setting to disable this mirroring?
        - Is this even possible?
    * Typing '<xref ref=""' results in a spurious error ("ref/cite:
      unrecognized format")
    * Potential for confusion since Symbols List is always based on
      the current project (or open folder) but the ref autocomplete
      list may not be (if there is not an explicit project and the
      root PreTeXt file is set globally or not at all)
