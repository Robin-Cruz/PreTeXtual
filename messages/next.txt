Release notes:

    * This is a release candidate version of PreTeXtual and may be buggier
      than usual.
    * Sublime Text build system added. Use Ctrl+Shift+B from within a PreTeXt
      file to process source from within Sublime Text. The build system
      assumes certain structure about your filesystem and you may need to edit
      it by hand to make it work, or move some files and directories on your
      system. The build system is intended for beginning users of PreTeXt at
      the moment and it does not support much customization natively. The
      official release of 0.6.0 will be more customizable and in particular
      will not require the use of the Vagrant box. See README.md for complete details on setting up your environment to use the build system commands.

Known issues from 0.5.0 not fixed in this release:

    * The scoping for embedded syntaxes is not completely satisfactory
    * Symbol recognition is not as good as before

Known issues from 0.4.5 not fixed in this release:

    * Symbol recognition lists are incomplete
    * Mirroring title text to get xml:id is good for divisions, but less
      good for theorems (often not titled)
    * Mirrored title text in snippet xml:id does not always give
      completely satisfactory results (e.g., XML tags inside)
        - Should there be a user setting to disable this mirroring?
        - Is this even possible?
    * Typing '<xref ref=""' results in a spurious error ("ref/cite:
      unrecognized format")
    * Potential for confusion since Symbols List is always based on
      the current project (or open folder) but the ref autocomplete
      list may not be (if there is not an explicit project and the
      root PreTeXt file is set globally or not at all)
