MBXTools package version 0.4.2

Release notes:

    * Added many new snippets for theorem-likes, axiom-likes
    * Reorganized package, putting snippets, completions, etc.
      into subfolders
    * There are a few changes in snippet triggers

Known issues:

    * Mirrored title text in snippet xml:id does not always give
      completely satisfactory results (e.g., XML tags inside)
        - Should there be a user setting to disable this mirroring?
        - Is this even possible?
    * MathBook XML syntax is inappropriately applied to newly opened
      files of other types in some instances
    * Typing '<xref ref=""' results in a spurious error ("ref/cite: 
      unrecognized format")
    * Potential for confusion since Symbols List is always based on
      the current project (or open folder) but the ref autocomplete
      list may not be (if there is not an explicit project and the
      root MBX file is set globally or not at all)
